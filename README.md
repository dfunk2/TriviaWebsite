Simple two question trivia website. HTM was used for the structure including DIV Classes to create sections and, DIV ID to make unique elements such as "button" and feedback1/feedback2. CSS was used to add color to each element of the website. Lastly, Javescript was used to make the website responsive. This includes the buttons and the websites response to the correct or wrong answer. This was a project for my Computer Science 162 class, but the project originally comes from the Harvard Computer Science 50 course and is guided.
